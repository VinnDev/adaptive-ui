# adaptive-ui

A highly opinionated extension for Mantine to quickly scaffold data-driven web prototypes

## Installation

1. Navigate to your React project's `/components/` directory
2. Run `git submodule add https://github.com/lorencerri/adaptive-ui`

## Styling

Internally, adaptive-ui uses [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) components and css variables. You can override the default styling by passing your own via the `MantineProvider` component.
